# Azure Data Service Go Fast - Deployment

In this section you will automatically provision all Azure resources required to run ADSGoFast Framework. We will use a pre-defined ARM template with the definition of all Azure services used for a small development environment.

## Azure services

The following Azure services will be deployed in your subscription:

## Deploy Azure Services
In this section you will use automated deployment and ARM templates to automate the deployment of all Azure Data Services.

1. You can deploy all Azure services required by clicking the **Deploy to Azure** button below. 

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmicrosoft%2Fazure-data-services-go-fast-codebase%2Fblob%2Fmain%2FDeploy%2Fazuredeploy.json)

[![Visualize](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/images/visualizebutton.svg?sanitize=true)](http://armviz.io/#/?load=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmicrosoft%2Fazure-data-services-go-fast-codebase%2Fblob%2Fmain%2FDeploy%2Fazuredeploy.json)

2. You will be directed to the Azure portal to deploy the ADS Go Fast ARM template from this repository. On the **Custom deployment** blade, enter the following details:


3. On the **Custom deployment** blade, enter the following details:
    <br>- **Subscription**: [your Azure subscription]
    <br>- **Resource group**: [you can select a existing Resource Group or create a new Resource Group]

    Please review the Terms and Conditions and check the box to indicate that you agree with them.

4. Click **Purchase**

## Access provisioning

- MSI 
    - Azure Data Factory uses MSI to authenticate to staging database (Azure SQL Database), Azure KeyVault and Azure Storage;
    - Azure Data Factory use SQL Authentication to authenticate to On-Prem SQL Server;
    - Azure Functions uses MSI to authenticate to ADSGoFast database (Azure SQL Database), Azure Storage, Azure Data Factory;


# Solution Deployment and Configuration
In this section you will use Azure DevOps to deploy Database project, Data Factory components (Pipeline, Datasets, LinkedServices and Integratiion Runtime) and Azure Functions.Click through the links below and follow the instructions provided.
